^^ good desciption of overall process and has bits of code (in python)

take in input
break down (into lines I'm guessing) and add scalars to create vector
each line comes in gray scale, 0 is black white is 1 (not sure if size is consistent, but each image is 8x8) 
divide by image and then comes in array oof decimals
define some stuff to be able to compare
